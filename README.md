# html-resume
A flask wrapper is built so that the resume can be generated using the pure text data from a `json` file. The original static html resume is at: https://github.com/mnjul/html-resume.

Sample `json` files can be found in the `json` folder.

In the main `flask_app.py` file, you could choose a subset of your experiences and selected projects to be included in this one-page resume template. 

The `style.css` is also modified so that it fits better with A4 prints.
